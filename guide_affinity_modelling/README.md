GFP sequence .fa files are from the [https://gitlab.com/sanjanalab/cas13/-/tree/master/Cas13designGuidePredictor/data](Cas13 guide screening paper's repository)
    Note that GFP.fa is used for the results of the guide screen, not GFP_ext.fa. 

Guide tiling results are from the "Tiling_screens" sheet of the [https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41587-020-0456-9/MediaObjects/41587_2020_456_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx](Supplementary Data 1) from the [Massively parallel Cas13 screens reveal principles for guide RNA design](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0456-9) paper.

The eGFP_CasRxguides.csv file was generated using their random forest model.
